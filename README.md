## Features

### Spotify Integration
- Paste any **Spotify album or song link** (including `spotify.link` short URLs). Tracks, durations, cover art, and URI load instantly via a client-credentials flow proxied through Next.js API routes.

### Apple Music Integration
- Paste a regional **Apple Music album or song link** (for example, `music.apple.com/de/...`). Album metadata, the complete track list, durations, release details, and high-resolution artwork load through the server-side Apple lookup proxy.
- Song share links using Apple Music's `?i=<song-id>` format are detected automatically.
- No additional Apple credentials are required for public catalog lookups.

### 14 Theme Presets (13 Layouts)
- **Classic** - Clean album poster with big cover, tracklist, and QR code.
- **Gallery** - Drake "More Life" inspired cream/dark panel with palette swatches.
- **Overlay** - Frosted glassmorphism card over a blurred full-bleed cover.
- **Editorial** - Magazine-style with massive title, italic year, labeled metadata columns.
- **Bold Block** - Comic-book poster with colored panel, vertical genre strip, thick grid borders.
- **Minimal** - Stripped-down, type-focused layout with arched art.
- **Immersive** - Full-bleed cover with outlined title and flowing track names over gradient.
- **Retro** - 70s disco poster with 3D-shadow title and framed duo-tone art.
- **Cassette J-Card** - Three-panel cassette insert with spine, front cover, and tracklist back.
- **Comic Strip** - Pop-art poster with speech bubbles, price tag, and halftone dots.
- **Retro Playlist** - Vintage polaroid with rotated quote and color swatches.
- **Wave Overlay** - Floating frosted glass text plate over full album art.
- **Receipt** / **Red Receipt** - Stylized supermarket receipt with dashed dividers, in mono or red ink.

Every preset shows a **mini layout preview** in the sidebar picker, and long album titles **auto-scale** on display-type layouts so nothing clips.

### Album Art Controls
- **B&W / Color** toggle for the cover art.
- **Custom Frame Art** - Fine-tune how the artwork fits your poster layout to match your physical frame:
  - **Zoom** slider (0.5x-2.0x) - shrink to fit or crop into detail.
  - **Horizontal & Vertical Position** - shift the crop focus point.
  - **Brightness & Contrast** sliders - lighten, darken, or punch up the art.

### Typography & Color
- Independent **Title Scale** and **Tracklist Scale** sliders.
- **Font color** presets (Auto, White, Black, Cream, Gold) + custom color picker.
- **Quote font** selector (Dancing Script, Pacifico, Inter, Space Mono, Playfair Display, Caveat).
- Show/hide toggles for **Timestamp** and **Artist** metadata.

### AI Theme Builder
- Copy a built-in AI prompt, paste it (with a reference poster image) into **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, or **Gemini**, then upload the generated CSS to instantly restyle your poster.

### Export
- **PNG** and **PDF** with configurable DPI (**150** Draft, **300** Print, **600** Ultra).
- Frame sizes: **4x6"**, **5x7"**, **A5**, **A4**, **30x40 cm** — exact output dimensions shown before you export.
- The poster renders at a fixed internal size, so exports are **pixel-identical on any screen or window size**.

### Background Effects
- Blurred album bloom, dominant-color overlay & vignette via canvas-based palette extraction.
- Optional ghost watermark layer.
- Solid or gradient background from album palette.
- QR Code or Spotify Scannable Code.

### Quality of Life
- **Fullscreen preview** mode with keyboard shortcut (Escape to exit).
- **Undo/Redo** for all poster overrides (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z).
- **Recent albums** history (persisted in localStorage, max 6).
- **Responsive** mobile prompt recommending desktop for best experience.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Spotify API Credentials

1. Create an app in the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
2. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the project root:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Add your Spotify credentials:
   ```
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   ```

Apple Music works without environment variables. It uses Apple's public, ID-based catalog lookup endpoint and keeps requests server-side so the same flow works locally and on Vercel.

## Build & Deploy

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Deploy anywhere that supports Next.js 14 (e.g. Vercel). Spotify requires the two environment variables above; Apple Music needs no extra configuration. Album artwork is loaded from Spotify's `i.scdn.co` or Apple's `mzstatic.com` CDN, both declared in `next.config.mjs`.
